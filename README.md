# Hello! I'm known online as ImDarkDiamond

I've been developing for almost 4 years now and have no plans on stopping anytime soon. I am a passionate developer who trys to optimize everything to perfection. I mainly work in Node.js, Vue.js, TypeScript, and Go. Currently I maintain and operate one of the largest bots on [Discord](https://discord.com) which you can view on it's [website](https://arcanebot.xyz). I'm currently in high school and am set on going to college to become an Anesthesiologist.
