# Hello! I'm known online as ImDarkDiamond

I've been developing for almost 5 years now and have no plans on stopping anytime soon. I am a passionate developer who trys to optimize everything to perfection but fails frequently :P. I mainly work in Node.js, Vue.js, Rust, and TypeScript. Currently I maintain and operate one of the largest bots (#31 out of millions) on [Discord](https://discord.com) which you can view on it's [website](https://arcane.bot). I'm currently in high school and am set on going to college to become an Anesthesiologist.

## Projects
- ðŸ¤– [`Arcane`](https://arcane.bot) - A super customizable bot for the Discord platform with many features such as leveling, moderation, and more. Written in Rust and TypeScript. 
- ðŸ¤– [`Server Captcha Bot`](https://servercaptchabot.xyz) - A discord bot to prevent automated raids. 

## Old Projects
- ðŸ’¯ [`Redis Sharder`](https://github.com/arcanebot/redis-sharder) - One of the simplest and robust sharding libraries for Discord bots using Eris. Previously used in production with `Arcane` but Eris no longer scaled as far as we thought it would.
